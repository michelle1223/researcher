## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="github_memoticon.png">

Hi! I am a master's student of the Department of Statistics and Data Science at Yonsei University, Seoul.

## Research Interest

I am broadly interested in the **AI/ML applications in real-world business**. Specifically, I am interested in popularity bias and diversity problems that occur when AI/ML technologies are implemented, such as the long-tail problem or cold start problem in e-commerce/recommender systems. I am also interested in how these technologies can be used for business goals such as consumer demand/preference estimation. Previously, I have done research in the area of imbalanced classification and economic index construction based on deep-learning approaches.
